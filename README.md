# README

I started this project to test Rails 7 with importmap and Bootstrap. I've followed the steps described [here](https://dev.to/coorasse/rails-7-bootstrap-5-and-importmaps-without-nodejs-4g8)

After following those steps, I added a simple index page with a navbar, taken from [these Bootstrap examples](https://getbootstrap.com/docs/4.1/components/navbar/). Unfortunately, I couldn't make javascript work properly: the dropdown doesn't work.
